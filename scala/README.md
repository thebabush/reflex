# jReflex

Scala port of the original Haskell part of Reflex.

## Building

```sh
$ sbt assembly
```

If the JVM stars are JVM aligned you will find `jreflex.jar` in the current
directory.

## Run

After the assembly phase, you can use the helper script `optimize.sh`.
Otherwise, you can use `sbt run`.
